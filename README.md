# LibTorchTest
This is a sample project for LibTorch integration inside an iOS framework

This project is using cocoapods, so in order to run the project, please make sure to run `pod update` after navigating to the TorchTest folder.

Building the project for simulator would succeed, but running Tests on the simulator would fail..
